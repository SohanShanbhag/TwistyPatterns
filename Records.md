World's Fastest
The current record held for the fastest solve of the Rubik’s Cube is currently 3.47 seconds by Yusheng Du, who beat the record of Feliks Zemdegs by 0.75 seconds. A robot, however, has solved the Rubik’s Cube in an incredible 0.38 seconds!!

Speedcubers do not just stop at rapidly solving the traditional Cube with their hands….Feliks also holds the record for the fastest one-handed solve of 6.88 seconds, and Jakub Kipa from Poland solves the Cube with his feet in an impressive 20.57 seconds!
